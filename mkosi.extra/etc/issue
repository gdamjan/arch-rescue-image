systemd-networkd automatically configures ethernet and wlan station interfaces
with DHCP.  For wlan0 interfaces, you first need to connect via iwctl:

    [iwd]# device list
    [iwd]# station \e{green}device\e{reset} scan
    [iwd]# station \e{green}device\e{reset} get-networks
    [iwd]# station \e{green}device\e{reset} connect \e{green}SSID\e{reset}

This image comes with a number of tools, including ripgrep, broot, nano, etc.
The default shell is fish, the Friendly Interactive Shell.

Once network connectivity is established you can install additional packages
with pacman -S.  The default mirrorlist use world-wide geo-locating mirrors;
install reflector to create a mirrorlist with local mirrors.

Good luck with recovery :)
